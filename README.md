# flipPIL

flipPIL is an experimental module for python that is designed specifically for mechanical flip dot displays. It is currently only designed for "alfa-zeta" designed flip dots as it is the only type of display it has been tested with.

The idea was to make it a bit higher level by integrating it into the Python Imageing Library (PIL). It is basically a class based wrapper around the Image module that creates a 1 bit image that can be manipulated by modules such as ImageDraw so you can draw circles and text with little trouble.
